# DDML-STATA
Stata scripts for causal inference and outcome prediction using DDML (Double/Debiased Machine Learning). The code implements cross-validation (k-folds) for estimating treatment effects and predicting outcomes using gradient boosting models. It applies the `pystacked` method for both treatment and outcome models with robust standard errors.
